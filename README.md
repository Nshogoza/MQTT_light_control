# 💡 Light Control Web Application

This project is a **web-based light control system** that allows users to switch a light **ON** or **OFF** remotely using **MQTT**. The light is simulated by an **ESP8266 device** and controlled via a simple web interface. 🌐💡  

## 🚀 Features
✅ Web-based control panel for switching the light ON/OFF  
✅ Uses **MQTT** protocol for seamless communication  
✅ Simulated IoT device using **Python**  
✅ Connects to a **public MQTT broker**  

## 🛠 How to Run

1️⃣ **Start the simulated IoT device**  
   Run the Python script to simulate the ESP8266 light system:  
   ```bash
   python light_simulation.py
